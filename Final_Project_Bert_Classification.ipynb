The_  \\r\\n| _notice must include:_  \\r\\n|  _(1) the following statement:_  \\r\\n| _\"PROPOSED (tax year) PROPERTY TAX BILL INFORMATION_  \\r\\n|  _\"Information concerning the (insert tax year) property taxes_  \\r\\n| _on your property proposed by your local taxing units, together with_  \\r\\n| _information about expressing your support for or opposition to the_  \\r\\n| _proposed property taxes, may be found in the real-time tax notice at_  \\r\\n| _the website listed below:_  \\r\\n|  _\"(address of the Internet website at which the information_  \\r\\n| _may be found)\";_  \\r\\n|  _(2)_ _____a statement that the property owner may request_  \\r\\n| _from the county assessor-collector contact information for the_  \\r\\n| _assessor for each taxing unit in which the property is located, who_  \\r\\n| _must provide the information described by this subsection to the_  \\r\\n| _owner on request; and_  \\r\\n|  _(3)_ _____the address and telephone number of the county_  \\r\\n| _assessor-collector._  \\r\\n|  _(e-3)_ _____The heading of the statement described by Subsection_  \\r\\n| _(e-2)(1) must be in bold, capital letters in type larger than that_  \\r\\n| _used in the other provisions of the notice._  \\r\\n|  _(e-4)_ _____The comptroller may adopt rules regarding the format_  \\r\\n| _and delivery of the notice required by Subsection (e-2)._  \\r\\n|  _(e-5)_ _____The governing body of a taxing unit shall include as_  \\r\\n| _an appendix to the taxing unit's budget for a fiscal year the tax_  \\r\\n| _rate calculation forms used by the designated officer or employee_  \\r\\n| _of the taxing unit to calculate the no-new-revenue tax rate and the_  \\r\\n| _rollback tax rate of the taxing unit for the tax year in which the_  \\r\\n| _fiscal year begins._  \\r\\n|  (f) If as a result of consolidation of taxing units a taxing  \\r\\n| unit includes territory that was in two or more taxing units in the  \\r\\n| preceding year, the amount of taxes imposed in each in the preceding  \\r\\n| year is combined for purposes of calculating the _no-new-revenue_  \\r\\n| [ ~~effective~~ ] and rollback tax rates under this section.  \\r\\n|  (g) A person who owns taxable property is entitled to an  \\r\\n| injunction prohibiting the taxing unit in which the property is  \\r\\n| taxable from adopting a tax rate if the assessor or designated  \\r\\n| officer or employee of the _taxing_ unit, _the tax notice officer of_  \\r\\n| _the applicable appraisal district, or the taxing unit,_ as  \\r\\n| applicable, has not complied with the computation _,_ [ ~~or~~ ]  \\r\\n| publication _, or posting_ requirements of this section _or Section_  \\r\\n| _26.16, 26.17, or 26.18_ [ ~~and the failure to comply was not in good~~  \\r\\n|  ~~faith~~ ].  _It is a defense in an action for an injunction under this_  \\r\\n| _subsection that the failure to comply was in good faith._  \\r\\n|  _(h-1)_ _____Notwithstanding Subsection (h), if the anticipated_  \\r\\n| _collection rate of a taxing unit as calculated under that_  \\r\\n| _subsection is lower than the lowest actual collection rate of the_  \\r\\n| _taxing unit for any of the preceding three years, the anticipated_  \\r\\n| _collection rate of the taxing unit for purposes of this section is_  \\r\\n| _equal to the lowest actual collection rate of the taxing unit for_  \\r\\n| _any of the preceding three years._  \\r\\n|  _(h-2)_ _____The anticipated collection rate of a taxing unit for_  \\r\\n| _purposes of this section is the rate calculated under Subsection_  \\r\\n| _(h) as modified by Subsection (h-1), if applicable, regardless of_  \\r\\n| _whether that rate exceeds 100 percent._  \\r\\n|  (i) This subsection applies to a taxing unit that has agreed  \\r\\n| by written contract to transfer a distinct department, function, or  \\r\\n| activity to another taxing unit and discontinues operating that  \\r\\n| distinct department, function, or activity if the operation of that  \\r\\n| department, function, or activity in all or a majority of the  \\r\\n| territory of the taxing unit is continued by another existing  \\r\\n| taxing unit or by a new taxing unit. The rollback tax rate of a  \\r\\n| taxing unit to which this subsection applies in the first tax year  \\r\\n| in which a budget is adopted that does not allocate revenue to the  \\r\\n| discontinued department, function, or activity is calculated as  \\r\\n| otherwise provided by this section, except that last year's levy  \\r\\n| used to calculate the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and  \\r\\n| operations rate of the _taxing_ unit is reduced by the amount of  \\r\\n| maintenance and operations tax revenue spent by the taxing unit to  \\r\\n| operate the department, function, or activity for the 12 months  \\r\\n| preceding the month in which the calculations required by this  \\r\\n| chapter are made and in which the _taxing_ unit operated the  \\r\\n| discontinued department, function, or activity. If the _taxing_ unit  \\r\\n| did not operate that department, function, or activity for the full  \\r\\n| 12 months preceding the month in which the calculations required by  \\r\\n| this chapter are made, the _taxing_ unit shall reduce last year's levy  \\r\\n| used for calculating the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance  \\r\\n| and operations rate of the _taxing_ unit by the amount of the revenue  \\r\\n| spent in the last full fiscal year in which the _taxing_ unit operated  \\r\\n| the discontinued department, function, or activity.  \\r\\n|  (j) This subsection applies to a taxing unit that had agreed  \\r\\n| by written contract to accept the transfer of a distinct  \\r\\n| department, function, or activity from another taxing unit and  \\r\\n| operates a distinct department, function, or activity if the  \\r\\n| operation of a substantially similar department, function, or  \\r\\n| activity in all or a majority of the territory of the taxing unit  \\r\\n| has been discontinued by another taxing unit, including a dissolved  \\r\\n| taxing unit. The rollback tax rate of a taxing unit to which this  \\r\\n| subsection applies in the first tax year after the other taxing unit  \\r\\n| discontinued the substantially similar department, function, or  \\r\\n| activity in which a budget is adopted that allocates revenue to the  \\r\\n| department, function, or activity is calculated as otherwise  \\r\\n| provided by this section, except that last year's levy used to  \\r\\n| calculate the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and  \\r\\n| operations rate of the _taxing_ unit is increased by the amount of  \\r\\n| maintenance and operations tax revenue spent by the taxing unit  \\r\\n| that discontinued operating the substantially similar department,  \\r\\n| function, or activity to operate that department, function, or  \\r\\n| activity for the 12 months preceding the month in which the  \\r\\n| calculations required by this chapter are made and in which the  \\r\\n| _taxing_ unit operated the discontinued department, function, or  \\r\\n| activity. If the _taxing_ unit did not operate the discontinued  \\r\\n| department, function, or activity for the full 12 months preceding  \\r\\n| the month in which the calculations required by this chapter are  \\r\\n| made, the _taxing_ unit may increase last year's levy used to  \\r\\n| calculate the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and  \\r\\n| operations rate by an amount not to exceed the amount of property  \\r\\n| tax revenue spent by the discontinuing _taxing_ unit to operate the  \\r\\n| discontinued department, function, or activity in the last full  \\r\\n| fiscal year in which the discontinuing _taxing_ unit operated the  \\r\\n| department, function, or activity.  \\r\\n|  SECTION 30. Section 26.041, Tax Code, is amended by  \\r\\n| amending Subsections (a), (b), (c), (e), (g), and (h) and adding  \\r\\n| Subsection (c-1) to read as follows:  \\r\\n|  (a) In the first year in which an additional sales and use  \\r\\n| tax is required to be collected, the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax  \\r\\n| rate and rollback tax rate for the _taxing_ unit are calculated  \\r\\n| according to the following formulas:  \\r\\n|  _NO-NEW-REVENUE_ [ ~~EFFECTIVE~~ ] TAX RATE = _[_ (LAST YEAR'S  \\r\\n| LEVY -

LOST PROPERTY LEVY) / (CURRENT TOTAL VALUE - NEW  \\r\\n| PROPERTY VALUE)] + SALES TAX LOSS RATE  \\r\\n| [ ~~and~~ ]  \\r\\n|  ROLLBACK TAX RATE _FOR SMALL TAXING UNIT_ = [(LAST YEAR'S  \\r\\n| MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS EXPENSE x 1.08) / ([ ~~TOTAL~~ ]  \\r\\n| CURRENT _TOTAL_ VALUE -

NEW PROPERTY_  \\r\\n| _VALUE)] + CURRENT DEBT RATE_  \\r\\n| where \"sales tax loss rate\" means a number expressed in dollars per  \\r\\n| $100 of taxable value, calculated by dividing the amount of sales  \\r\\n| and use tax revenue generated in the last four quarters for which  \\r\\n| the information is available by the current total value and \"last  \\r\\n| year's maintenance and operations expense\" means the amount spent  \\r\\n| for maintenance and operations from property tax and additional  \\r\\n| sales and use tax revenues in the preceding year.  \\r\\n|  _(c-1)_ _____Notwithstanding any other provision of this section,_  \\r\\n| _the governing body of a taxing unit other than a small taxing unit_  \\r\\n| _may direct the designated officer or employee to calculate the_  \\r\\n| _rollback tax rate of the taxing unit in the manner provided for a_  \\r\\n| _small taxing unit if any part of the taxing unit is located in an_  \\r\\n| _area declared a disaster area during the current tax year by the_  \\r\\n| _governor or by the president of the United States._ ___The designated_  \\r\\n| _officer or employee shall continue calculating the rollback tax_  \\r\\n| _rate in the manner provided by this subsection until the earlier of:_  \\r\\n|  _(1)_ _____the first tax year in which the total taxable value_  \\r\\n| _of property taxable by the taxing unit as shown on the appraisal_  \\r\\n| _roll for the taxing unit submitted by the assessor for the taxing_  \\r\\n| _unit to the governing body exceeds the total taxable value of_  \\r\\n| _property taxable by the taxing unit on January 1 of the tax year in_  \\r\\n| _which the disaster occurred; or_  \\r\\n|  _(2)_ _____the fifth tax year after the tax year in which the_  \\r\\n| _disaster occurred._  \\r\\n|  (e) If a city that imposes an additional sales and use tax  \\r\\n| receives payments under the terms of a contract executed before  \\r\\n| January 1, 1986, in which the city agrees not to annex certain  \\r\\n| property or a certain area and the owners or lessees of the property  \\r\\n| or of property in the area agree to pay at least annually to the city  \\r\\n| an amount determined by reference to all or a percentage of the  \\r\\n| property tax rate of the city and all or a part of the value of the  \\r\\n| property subject to the agreement or included in the area subject to  \\r\\n| the agreement, the governing body, by order adopted by a majority  \\r\\n| vote of the governing body, may direct the designated officer or  \\r\\n| employee to add to the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] and rollback tax  \\r\\n| rates the amount that, when applied to the total taxable value  \\r\\n| submitted to the governing body, would produce an amount of taxes  \\r\\n| equal to the difference between the total amount of payments for the  \\r\\n| tax year under contracts described by this subsection under the  \\r\\n| rollback tax rate calculated under this section and the total  \\r\\n| amount of payments for the tax year that would have been obligated  \\r\\n| to the city if the city had not adopted an additional sales and use  \\r\\n| tax.  \\r\\n|  (g) If the rate of the additional sales and use tax is  \\r\\n| increased, the designated officer or employee shall make two  \\r\\n| projections, in the manner provided by Subsection (d) [ ~~of this~~  \\r\\n|  ~~section~~ ], of the revenue generated by the additional sales and use  \\r\\n| tax in the following year. The first projection must take into  \\r\\n| account the increase and the second projection must not take into  \\r\\n| account the increase. The _designated_ officer or employee shall  \\r\\n| then subtract the amount of the result of the second projection from  \\r\\n| the amount of the result of the first projection to determine the  \\r\\n| revenue generated as a result of the increase in the additional  \\r\\n| sales and use tax. In the first year in which an additional sales  \\r\\n| and use tax is increased, the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate  \\r\\n| for the _taxing_ unit is the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate  \\r\\n| before the increase minus a number the numerator of which is the  \\r\\n| revenue generated as a result of the increase in the additional  \\r\\n| sales and use tax, as determined under this subsection, and the  \\r\\n| denominator of which is the current total value minus the new  \\r\\n| property value.  \\r\\n|  (h) If the rate of the additional sales and use tax is  \\r\\n| decreased, the designated officer or employee shall make two  \\r\\n| projections, in the manner provided by Subsection (d) [ ~~of this~~  \\r\\n|  ~~section~~ ], of the revenue generated by the additional sales and use  \\r\\n| tax in the following year. The first projection must take into  \\r\\n| account the decrease and the second projection must not take into  \\r\\n| account the decrease. The _designated_ officer or employee shall  \\r\\n| then subtract the amount of the result of the first projection from  \\r\\n| the amount of the result of the second projection to determine the  \\r\\n| revenue lost as a result of the decrease in the additional sales and  \\r\\n| use tax. In the first year in which an additional sales and use tax  \\r\\n| is decreased, the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate for the  \\r\\n| _taxing_ unit is the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate before the  \\r\\n| decrease plus a number the numerator of which is the revenue lost as  \\r\\n| a result of the decrease in the additional sales and use tax, as  \\r\\n| determined under this subsection, and the denominator of which is  \\r\\n| the current total value minus the new property value.  \\r\\n|  SECTION 31. The heading to Section 26.043, Tax Code, is  \\r\\n| amended to read as follows:  \\r\\n|  Sec. 26.043. _ROLLBACK AND NO-NEW-REVENUE_ [ ~~EFFECTIVE~~ ] TAX  \\r\\n| _RATES_ [ ~~RATE~~ ] IN CITY IMPOSING MASS TRANSIT SALES AND USE TAX.  \\r\\n|  SECTION 32. Sections 26.043(a) and (b), Tax Code, are  \\r\\n| amended to read as follows:  \\r\\n|  (a) In the tax year in which a city has set an election on  \\r\\n| the question of whether to impose a local sales and use tax under  \\r\\n| Subchapter H, Chapter 453, Transportation Code, the officer or  \\r\\n| employee designated to make the calculations provided by Section  \\r\\n| 26.04 may not make those calculations until the outcome of the  \\r\\n| election is determined. If the election is determined in favor of  \\r\\n| the imposition of the tax, the _designated officer or employee_  \\r\\n| [ ~~representative~~ ] shall subtract from the city's rollback and  \\r\\n| _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rates the amount that, if applied to  \\r\\n| the city's current total value, would impose an amount equal to the  \\r\\n| amount of property taxes budgeted in the current tax year to pay for  \\r\\n| expenses related to mass transit services.  \\r\\n|  (b) In a tax year to which this section applies, a reference  \\r\\n| in this chapter to the city's _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] or  \\r\\n| rollback tax rate refers to that rate as adjusted under this  \\r\\n| section.  \\r\\n|  SECTION 33. The heading to Section 26.044, Tax Code, is  \\r\\n| amended to read as follows:  \\r\\n|  Sec. 26.044. _NO-NEW-REVENUE_ [ ~~EFFECTIVE~~ ] TAX RATE TO PAY FOR  \\r\\n| STATE CRIMINAL JUSTICE MANDATE.  \\r\\n|  SECTION 34. Sections 26.044(a), (b), and (c), Tax Code, are  \\r\\n| amended to read as follows:  \\r\\n|  (a) The first time that a county adopts a tax rate after  \\r\\n| September 1, 1991, in which the state criminal justice mandate  \\r\\n| applies to the county, the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance  \\r\\n| and operation rate for the county is increased by the rate  \\r\\n| calculated according to the following formula:  \\r\\n|  (State Criminal Justice Mandate) / (Current Total  \\r\\n| Value - New Property Value)  \\r\\n|  (b) In the second and subsequent years that a county adopts  \\r\\n| a tax rate, if the amount spent by the county for the state criminal  \\r\\n| justice mandate increased over the previous year, the  \\r\\n| _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and operation rate for the  \\r\\n| county is increased by the rate calculated according to the  \\r\\n| following formula:  \\r\\n|  (This Year's State Criminal Justice Mandate - Previous  \\r\\n| Year's State Criminal Justice Mandate) / (Current  \\r\\n| Total Value - New Property Value)  \\r\\n|  (c) The county shall include a notice of the increase in the  \\r\\n| _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and operation rate provided  \\r\\n| by this section, including a description and amount of the state  \\r\\n| criminal justice mandate, in the information published under  \\r\\n| Section 26.04(e) and Section 26.06(b) [ ~~of this code~~ ].  \\r\\n|  SECTION 35. Sections 26.0441(a), (b), and (c), Tax Code,  \\r\\n| are amended to read as follows:  \\r\\n|  (a) In the first tax year in which a taxing unit adopts a tax  \\r\\n| rate after January 1, 2000, and in which the enhanced minimum  \\r\\n| eligibility standards for indigent health care established under  \\r\\n| Section 61.006, Health and Safety Code, apply to the taxing unit,  \\r\\n| the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and operations rate for  \\r\\n| the taxing unit is increased by the rate computed according to the  \\r\\n| following formula:  \\r\\n|  Amount of Increase = Enhanced Indigent Health Care  \\r\\n| Expenditures / (Current Total Value - New Property  \\r\\n| Value)  \\r\\n|  (b) In each subsequent tax year, if the taxing unit's  \\r\\n| enhanced indigent health care expenses exceed the amount of those  \\r\\n| expenses for the preceding year, the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ]  \\r\\n| maintenance and operations rate for the taxing unit is increased by  \\r\\n| the rate computed according to the following formula:  \\r\\n|  Amount of Increase = (Current Tax Year's Enhanced  \\r\\n| Indigent Health Care Expenditures - Preceding Tax  \\r\\n| Year's Indigent Health Care Expenditures) / (Current  \\r\\n| Total Value - New Property Value)  \\r\\n|  (c) The taxing unit shall include a notice of the increase  \\r\\n| in its _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and operations rate  \\r\\n| provided by this section, including a brief description and the  \\r\\n| amount of the enhanced indigent health care expenditures, in the  \\r\\n| information published under Section 26.04(e) and, if applicable,  \\r\\n| Section 26.06(b).  \\r\\n|  SECTION 36. Section 26.05, Tax Code, is amended by amending  \\r\\n| Subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (g) and adding Subsections  \\r\\n| (d-1), (d-2), and (e-1) to read as follows:  \\r\\n|  (a) The governing body of each taxing unit[ ~~, before the~~  \\r\\n|  ~~later of September 30 or the 60th day after the date the certified~~  \\r\\n|  ~~appraisal roll is received by the taxing unit,~~ ] shall adopt a tax  \\r\\n| rate for the current tax year and shall notify the assessor for the  \\r\\n| _taxing_ unit of the rate adopted.  _The governing body must adopt a_  \\r\\n| _tax rate before the later of September 30 or the 60th day after the_  \\r\\n| _date the certified appraisal roll is received by the taxing unit,_  \\r\\n| _except that the governing body must adopt a tax rate that exceeds_  \\r\\n| _the rollback tax rate before August 15._ The tax rate consists of  \\r\\n| two components, each of which must be approved separately.  The  \\r\\n| components are:  \\r\\n|  (1) for a taxing unit other than a school district, the  \\r\\n| rate that, if applied to the total taxable value, will impose the  \\r\\n| total amount published under Section 26.04(e)(3)(C), less any  \\r\\n| amount of additional sales and use tax revenue that will be used to  \\r\\n| pay debt service, or, for a school district, the rate calculated  \\r\\n| under Section 44.004(c)(5)(A)(ii)(b), Education Code; and  \\r\\n|  (2) the rate that, if applied to the total taxable  \\r\\n| value, will impose the amount of taxes needed to fund maintenance  \\r\\n| and operation expenditures of the _taxing_ unit for the next year.  \\r\\n|  (b) A taxing unit may not impose property taxes in any year  \\r\\n| until the governing body has adopted a tax rate for that year, and  \\r\\n| the annual tax rate must be set by ordinance, resolution, or order,  \\r\\n| depending on the method prescribed by law for adoption of a law by  \\r\\n| the governing body. The vote on the ordinance, resolution, or order  \\r\\n| setting the tax rate must be separate from the vote adopting the  \\r\\n| budget.

The date on which the taxes  \\r\\n| become delinquent for the year is extended by a number of days equal  \\r\\n| to the number of days between the date the first tax bills were sent  \\r\\n| and the date the corrected tax bills were sent.  \\r\\n|  (d-2) If a property owner pays taxes calculated using the  \\r\\n| originally adopted tax rate of the _taxing unit_ [ ~~school district~~ ]  \\r\\n| and the proposition to approve the adopted tax rate is not approved  \\r\\n| by _the_ voters, the _taxing unit_ [ ~~school district~~ ] shall refund the  \\r\\n| difference between the amount of taxes paid and the amount due under  \\r\\n| the subsequently adopted rate if the difference between the amount  \\r\\n| of taxes paid and the amount due under the subsequent rate is $1 or  \\r\\n| more.  If the difference between the amount of taxes paid and the  \\r\\n| amount due under the subsequent rate is less than $1, the _taxing_  \\r\\n| _unit_ [ ~~school district~~ ] shall refund the difference on request of  \\r\\n| the taxpayer.  An application for a refund of less than $1 must be  \\r\\n| made within 90 days after the date the refund becomes due or the  \\r\\n| taxpayer forfeits the right to the refund.  \\r\\n|  (e) For purposes of this section, local tax funds dedicated  \\r\\n| to a junior college district under Section 45.105(e), Education  \\r\\n| Code, shall be eliminated from the calculation of the tax rate  \\r\\n| adopted by the governing body of _a_ [ ~~the~~ ] school district. However,  \\r\\n| the funds dedicated to the junior college district are subject to  \\r\\n| Section 26.085.  \\r\\n|  (g) In a school district that received distributions from an  \\r\\n| equalization tax imposed under former Chapter 18, Education Code,  \\r\\n| the _no-new-revenue tax_ [ ~~effective~~ ] rate of that tax as of the date  \\r\\n| of the county unit system's abolition is added to the district's  \\r\\n| rollback tax rate.  \\r\\n|  (h) For purposes of this section, increases in taxable  \\r\\n| values and tax levies occurring within a reinvestment zone  \\r\\n| _designated_ under Chapter 311 [ ~~(Tax Increment Financing Act),~~ ] in  \\r\\n| which _a school_ [ ~~the~~ ] district is a participant[ ~~,~~ ] shall be  \\r\\n| eliminated from the calculation of the tax rate adopted by the  \\r\\n| governing body of the school district.  \\r\\n|  (i) For purposes of this section, the _no-new-revenue_  \\r\\n| [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and operations tax rate of a school  \\r\\n| district is the tax rate that, applied to the current total value  \\r\\n| for the district, would impose taxes in an amount that, when added  \\r\\n| to state funds that would be distributed to the district under  \\r\\n| Chapter 42, Education Code, for the school year beginning in the  \\r\\n| current tax year using that tax rate, would provide the same amount  \\r\\n| of state funds distributed under Chapter 42, Education Code, and  \\r\\n| maintenance and operations taxes of the district per student in  \\r\\n| weighted average daily attendance for that school year that would  \\r\\n| have been available to the district in the preceding year if the  \\r\\n| funding elements for Chapters 41 and 42, Education Code, for the  \\r\\n| current year had been in effect for the preceding year.  \\r\\n|  (n) For purposes of this section, the rollback tax rate of a  \\r\\n| school district [ ~~whose maintenance and operations tax rate for the~~  \\r\\n|  ~~2005 tax year was $1.50 or less per $100 of taxable value~~ ] is _the\\r\\nsum_  \\r\\n| _of the following_ :  \\r\\n|  (1) _the rate per $100 of taxable value that is equal to_  \\r\\n| _the product of the no-new-revenue maintenance and operations tax_  \\r\\n| _rate of the district as computed under Subsection (i) and 1.025_ [ ~~for~~  \\r\\n|  ~~the 2006 tax year, the sum of the rate that is equal to 88.67 percent~~  \\r\\n|  ~~of the maintenance and operations tax rate adopted by the district~~  \\r\\n|  ~~for the 2005 tax year, the rate of $0.04 per $100 of taxable value,~~  \\r\\n|  ~~and the district's current debt rate~~ ];

The board is not required to postpone a hearing more than  \\r\\n| one time under this subsection.  \\r\\n|  (i) A hearing on a protest filed by a property owner _or the_  \\r\\n| _designated agent of the owner_ [ ~~who is not represented by an agent~~  \\r\\n|  ~~designated under Section 1.111~~ ] shall be set for a time and date  \\r\\n| certain.  If the hearing is not commenced within two hours of the  \\r\\n| time set for the hearing, the appraisal review board shall postpone  \\r\\n| the hearing on the request of the property owner _or the designated_  \\r\\n| _agent of the owner_.  \\r\\n|  (j) On the request of a property owner or _the_ [ ~~a~~ ] designated  \\r\\n| agent _of the owner_ , an appraisal review board shall schedule  \\r\\n| hearings on protests concerning up to 20 designated properties _to_  \\r\\n| _be held consecutively_ on the same day.  The designated properties  \\r\\n| must be identified in the same notice of protest, and the notice  \\r\\n| must contain in boldfaced type the statement \"request for same-day  \\r\\n| protest hearings.\"  A property owner or _the_ designated agent _of the_  \\r\\n| _owner_ may [ ~~not~~ ] file more than one request under this subsection  \\r\\n| with the appraisal review board in the same tax year.  The appraisal  \\r\\n| review board may schedule hearings on protests concerning more than  \\r\\n| 20 properties filed by the same property owner or _the_ designated  \\r\\n| agent _of the owner_ and may use different panels to conduct the  \\r\\n| hearings based on the board's customary scheduling.  The appraisal  \\r\\n| review board may follow the practices customarily used by the board  \\r\\n| in the scheduling of hearings under this subsection.  \\r\\n|  _(j-1)_ _____An appraisal review board may schedule the hearings on_  \\r\\n| _all protests filed by a property owner or the designated agent of_  \\r\\n| _the owner to be held consecutively. The notice of the hearings must_  \\r\\n| _state the date and time that the first hearing will begin, state the_  \\r\\n| _date the last hearing will end, and list the order in which the_  \\r\\n| _hearings will be held. The order of the hearings listed in the_  \\r\\n| _notice may not be changed without the agreement of the property_  \\r\\n| _owner or the designated agent of the owner, the chief appraiser, and_  \\r\\n| _the appraisal review board. The board may not reschedule a hearing_  \\r\\n| _for which notice is given under this subsection to a date earlier_  \\r\\n| _than the seventh day after the date the last hearing was scheduled_  \\r\\n| _to end unless agreed to by the property owner or the designated_  \\r\\n| _agent of the owner, the chief appraiser, and the appraisal review_  \\r\\n| _board.

If a protest is scheduled to be heard by a  \\r\\n| particular panel, the protest may not be reassigned to another  \\r\\n| panel without the consent of the property owner or _the_ designated  \\r\\n| agent _of the owner_. If the appraisal review board has cause to  \\r\\n| reassign a protest to another panel, a property owner or _the_  \\r\\n| designated agent _of the owner_ may agree to reassignment of the  \\r\\n| protest or may request that the hearing on the protest be postponed.  \\r\\n| The board shall postpone the hearing on that request. A change of  \\r\\n| members of a panel because of a conflict of interest, illness, or  \\r\\n| inability to continue participating in hearings for the remainder  \\r\\n| of the day does not constitute reassignment of a protest to another  \\r\\n| panel.  \\r\\n|  _(k-1)_ _____On the request of a property owner or the designated_  \\r\\n| _agent of the owner, an appraisal review board to which Section 6.425_  \\r\\n| _applies shall assign a protest relating to property described by_  \\r\\n| _Section 6.425(b) to a special panel. In addition, the chairman of_  \\r\\n| _the appraisal review board may assign a protest relating to_  \\r\\n| _property not described by Section 6.425(b) to a special panel as_  \\r\\n| _authorized by Section 6.425(f). Protests assigned to special_  \\r\\n| _panels shall be randomly assigned to those panels. If a protest is_  \\r\\n| _scheduled to be heard by a particular special panel, the protest may_  \\r\\n| _not be reassigned to another special panel without the consent of_  \\r\\n| _the property owner or the designated agent of the owner. If the_  \\r\\n| _board has cause to reassign a protest to another special panel, a_  \\r\\n| _property owner or the designated agent of the owner may agree to_  \\r\\n| _reassignment of the protest or may request that the hearing on the_  \\r\\n| _protest be postponed. The board shall postpone the hearing on that_  \\r\\n| _request. A change of members of a special panel because of a_  \\r\\n| _conflict of interest, illness, or inability to continue_  \\r\\n| _participating in hearings for the remainder of the day does not_  \\r\\n| _constitute reassignment of a protest to another special panel._  \\r\\n|  _(p)_ _____At the end of a hearing on a protest, the appraisal_  \\r\\n| _review board shall provide the property owner or the designated_  \\r\\n| _agent of the owner one or more documents indicating that the members_  \\r\\n| _of the board hearing the protest signed the affidavit required by_  \\r\\n| _Subsection (g)._  \\r\\n|  SECTION 56.

The rollback tax rate of a  \\r\\n| taxing unit to which this subsection applies in the first tax year  \\r\\n| in which a budget is adopted that does not allocate revenue to the  \\r\\n| discontinued department, function, or activity is calculated as  \\r\\n| otherwise provided by this section, except that last year's levy  \\r\\n| used to calculate the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and  \\r\\n| operations rate of the _taxing_ unit is reduced by the amount of  \\r\\n| maintenance and operations tax revenue spent by the taxing unit to  \\r\\n| operate the department, function, or activity for the 12 months  \\r\\n| preceding the month in which the calculations required by this  \\r\\n| chapter are made and in which the _taxing_ unit operated the  \\r\\n| discontinued department, function, or activity. If the _taxing_ unit  \\r\\n| did not operate that department, function, or activity for the full  \\r\\n| 12 months preceding the month in which the calculations required by  \\r\\n| this chapter are made, the _taxing_ unit shall reduce last year's levy  \\r\\n| used for calculating the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance  \\r\\n| and operations rate of the _taxing_ unit by the amount of the revenue  \\r\\n| spent in the last full fiscal year in which the _taxing_ unit operated  \\r\\n| the discontinued department, function, or activity.  \\r\\n|  (j) This subsection applies to a taxing unit that had agreed  \\r\\n| by written contract to accept the transfer of a distinct  \\r\\n| department, function, or activity from another taxing unit and  \\r\\n| operates a distinct department, function, or activity if the  \\r\\n| operation of a substantially similar department, function, or  \\r\\n| activity in all or a majority of the territory of the taxing unit  \\r\\n| has been discontinued by another taxing unit, including a dissolved  \\r\\n| taxing unit. The rollback tax rate of a taxing unit to which this  \\r\\n| subsection applies in the first tax year after the other taxing unit  \\r\\n| discontinued the substantially similar department, function, or  \\r\\n| activity in which a budget is adopted that allocates revenue to the  \\r\\n| department, function, or activity is calculated as otherwise  \\r\\n| provided by this section, except that last year's levy used to  \\r\\n| calculate the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and  \\r\\n| operations rate of the _taxing_ unit is increased by the amount of  \\r\\n| maintenance and operations tax revenue spent by the taxing unit  \\r\\n| that discontinued operating the substantially similar department,  \\r\\n| function, or activity to operate that department, function, or  \\r\\n| activity for the 12 months preceding the month in which the  \\r\\n| calculations required by this chapter are made and in which the  \\r\\n| _taxing_ unit operated the discontinued department, function, or  \\r\\n| activity. If the _taxing_ unit did not operate the discontinued  \\r\\n| department, function, or activity for the full 12 months preceding  \\r\\n| the month in which the calculations required by this chapter are  \\r\\n| made, the _taxing_ unit may increase last year's levy used to  \\r\\n| calculate the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and  \\r\\n| operations rate by an amount not to exceed the amount of property  \\r\\n| tax revenue spent by the discontinuing _taxing_ unit to operate the  \\r\\n| discontinued department, function, or activity in the last full  \\r\\n| fiscal year in which the discontinuing _taxing_ unit operated the  \\r\\n| department, function, or activity.  \\r\\n|  SECTION 30. Section 26.041, Tax Code, is amended by  \\r\\n| amending Subsections (a), (b), (c), (e), (g), and (h) and adding  \\r\\n| Subsection (c-1) to read as follows:  \\r\\n|  (a) In the first year in which an additional sales and use  \\r\\n| tax is required to be collected, the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax  \\r\\n| rate and rollback tax rate for the _taxing_ unit are calculated  \\r\\n| according to the following formulas:  \\r\\n|  _NO-NEW-REVENUE_ [ ~~EFFECTIVE~~ ] TAX RATE = _[_ (LAST YEAR'S  \\r\\n| LEVY -

In the first year in which an additional sales  \\r\\n| and use tax is increased, the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate  \\r\\n| for the _taxing_ unit is the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate  \\r\\n| before the increase minus a number the numerator of which is the  \\r\\n| revenue generated as a result of the increase in the additional  \\r\\n| sales and use tax, as determined under this subsection, and the  \\r\\n| denominator of which is the current total value minus the new  \\r\\n| property value.  \\r\\n|  (h) If the rate of the additional sales and use tax is  \\r\\n| decreased, the designated officer or employee shall make two  \\r\\n| projections, in the manner provided by Subsection (d) [ ~~of this~~  \\r\\n|  ~~section~~ ], of the revenue generated by the additional sales and use  \\r\\n| tax in the following year. The first projection must take into  \\r\\n| account the decrease and the second projection must not take into  \\r\\n| account the decrease. The _designated_ officer or employee shall  \\r\\n| then subtract the amount of the result of the first projection from  \\r\\n| the amount of the result of the second projection to determine the  \\r\\n| revenue lost as a result of the decrease in the additional sales and  \\r\\n| use tax. In the first year in which an additional sales and use tax  \\r\\n| is decreased, the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate for the  \\r\\n| _taxing_ unit is the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate before the  \\r\\n| decrease plus a number the numerator of which is the revenue lost as  \\r\\n| a result of the decrease in the additional sales and use tax, as  \\r\\n| determined under this subsection, and the denominator of which is  \\r\\n| the current total value minus the new property value.  \\r\\n|  SECTION 31.

If the election is determined in favor of  \\r\\n| the imposition of the tax, the _designated officer or employee_  \\r\\n| [ ~~representative~~ ] shall subtract from the city's rollback and  \\r\\n| _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rates the amount that, if applied to  \\r\\n| the city's current total value, would impose an amount equal to the  \\r\\n| amount of property taxes budgeted in the current tax year to pay for  \\r\\n| expenses related to mass transit services.  \\r\\n|  (b) In a tax year to which this section applies, a reference  \\r\\n| in this chapter to the city's _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] or  \\r\\n| rollback tax rate refers to that rate as adjusted under this  \\r\\n| section.  \\r\\n|  SECTION 33. The heading to Section 26.044, Tax Code, is  \\r\\n| amended to read as follows:  \\r\\n|  Sec. 26.044. _NO-NEW-REVENUE_ [ ~~EFFECTIVE~~ ] TAX RATE TO PAY FOR  \\r\\n| STATE CRIMINAL JUSTICE MANDATE.  \\r\\n|  SECTION 34.

Sections 26.0441(a), (b), and (c), Tax Code,  \\r\\n| are amended to read as follows:  \\r\\n|  (a) In the first tax year in which a taxing unit adopts a tax  \\r\\n| rate after January 1, 2000, and in which the enhanced minimum  \\r\\n| eligibility standards for indigent health care established under  \\r\\n| Section 61.006, Health and Safety Code, apply to the taxing unit,  \\r\\n| the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and operations rate for  \\r\\n| the taxing unit is increased by the rate computed according to the  \\r\\n| following formula:  \\r\\n|  Amount of Increase = Enhanced Indigent Health Care  \\r\\n| Expenditures / (Current Total Value - New Property  \\r\\n| Value)  \\r\\n|  (b) In each subsequent tax year, if the taxing unit's  \\r\\n| enhanced indigent health care expenses exceed the amount of those  \\r\\n| expenses for the preceding year, the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ]  \\r\\n| maintenance and operations rate for the taxing unit is increased by  \\r\\n| the rate computed according to the following formula:  \\r\\n|  Amount of Increase = (Current Tax Year's Enhanced  \\r\\n| Indigent Health Care Expenditures - Preceding Tax  \\r\\n| Year's Indigent Health Care Expenditures) / (Current  \\r\\n| Total Value - New Property Value)  \\r\\n|  (c) The taxing unit shall include a notice of the increase  \\r\\n| in its _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and operations rate  \\r\\n| provided by this section, including a brief description and the  \\r\\n| amount of the enhanced indigent health care expenditures, in the  \\r\\n| information published under Section 26.04(e) and, if applicable,  \\r\\n| Section 26.06(b).  \\r\\n|  SECTION 36. Section 26.05, Tax Code, is amended by amending  \\r\\n| Subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (g) and adding Subsections  \\r\\n| (d-1), (d-2), and (e-1) to read as follows:  \\r\\n|  (a) The governing body of each taxing unit[ ~~, before the~~  \\r\\n|  ~~later of September 30 or the 60th day after the date the certified~~  \\r\\n|  ~~appraisal roll is received by the taxing unit,~~ ] shall adopt a tax  \\r\\n| rate for the current tax year and shall notify the assessor for the  \\r\\n| _taxing_ unit of the rate adopted.  _The governing body must adopt a_  \\r\\n| _tax rate before the later of September 30 or the 60th day after the_  \\r\\n| _date the certified appraisal roll is received by the taxing unit,_  \\r\\n| _except that the governing body must adopt a tax rate that exceeds_  \\r\\n| _the rollback tax rate before August 15._ The tax rate consists of  \\r\\n| two components, each of which must be approved separately.  The  \\r\\n| components are:  \\r\\n|  (1) for a taxing unit other than a school district, the  \\r\\n| rate that, if applied to the total taxable value, will impose the  \\r\\n| total amount published under Section 26.04(e)(3)(C), less any  \\r\\n| amount of additional sales and use tax revenue that will be used to  \\r\\n| pay debt service, or, for a school district, the rate calculated  \\r\\n| under Section 44.004(c)(5)(A)(ii)(b), Education Code; and  \\r\\n|  (2) the rate that, if applied to the total taxable  \\r\\n| value, will impose the amount of taxes needed to fund maintenance  \\r\\n| and operation expenditures of the _taxing_ unit for the next year.  \\r\\n|  (b) A taxing unit may not impose property taxes in any year  \\r\\n| until the governing body has adopted a tax rate for that year, and  \\r\\n| the annual tax rate must be set by ordinance, resolution, or order,  \\r\\n| depending on the method prescribed by law for adoption of a law by  \\r\\n| the governing body. The vote on the ordinance, resolution, or order  \\r\\n| setting the tax rate must be separate from the vote adopting the  \\r\\n| budget. For a taxing unit other than a school district, the vote on  \\r\\n| the ordinance, resolution, or order setting a tax rate that exceeds  \\r\\n| the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate must be a record vote, and  \\r\\n| at least 60 percent of the members of the governing body must vote  \\r\\n| in favor of the ordinance, resolution, or order. For a school  \\r\\n| district, the vote on the ordinance, resolution, or order setting a  \\r\\n| tax rate that exceeds the sum of the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ]  \\r\\n| maintenance and operations tax rate of the district as determined  \\r\\n| under Section 26.08(i) and the district's current debt rate must be  \\r\\n| a record vote, and at least 60 percent of the members of the  \\r\\n| governing body must vote in favor of the ordinance, resolution, or  \\r\\n| order. A motion to adopt an ordinance, resolution, or order setting  \\r\\n| a tax rate that exceeds the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate  \\r\\n| must be made in the following form: \"I move that the property tax  \\r\\n| rate be increased by the adoption of a tax rate of (specify tax  \\r\\n| rate), which is effectively a (insert percentage by which the  \\r\\n| proposed tax rate exceeds the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate)  \\r\\n| percent increase in the tax rate.\" If the ordinance, resolution, or  \\r\\n| order sets a tax rate that, if applied to the total taxable value,  \\r\\n| will impose an amount of taxes to fund maintenance and operation  \\r\\n| expenditures of the taxing unit that exceeds the amount of taxes  \\r\\n| imposed for that purpose in the preceding year, the taxing unit  \\r\\n| must:  \\r\\n|  (1) include in the ordinance, resolution, or order in  \\r\\n| type larger than the type used in any other portion of the document:  \\r\\n|  (A) the following statement:  \"THIS TAX RATE WILL  \\r\\n| RAISE MORE TAXES FOR MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS THAN LAST YEAR'S  \\r\\n| TAX RATE.\"; and  \\r\\n|  (B) if the tax rate exceeds the _no-new-revenue_  \\r\\n| [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and operations rate, the following  \\r\\n| statement:  \"THE TAX RATE WILL EFFECTIVELY BE RAISED BY (INSERT  \\r\\n| PERCENTAGE BY WHICH THE TAX RATE EXCEEDS THE _NO-NEW-REVENUE_  \\r\\n| [ ~~EFFECTIVE~~ ] MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS RATE) PERCENT AND WILL RAISE  \\r\\n| TAXES FOR MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS ON A $100,000 HOME BY  \\r\\n| APPROXIMATELY $(Insert amount).\"; and  \\r\\n|  (2) include on the home page of _the_ [ ~~any~~ ] Internet  \\r\\n| website _of_ [ ~~operated by~~ ] the _taxing_ unit:  \\r\\n|  (A) the following statement:  \"(Insert name of  \\r\\n| _taxing_ unit) ADOPTED A TAX RATE THAT WILL RAISE MORE TAXES FOR  \\r\\n| MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS THAN LAST YEAR'S TAX RATE\"; and  \\r\\n|  (B) if the tax rate exceeds the _no-new-revenue_  \\r\\n| [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and operations rate, the following  \\r\\n| statement:  \"THE TAX RATE WILL EFFECTIVELY BE RAISED BY (INSERT  \\r\\n| PERCENTAGE BY WHICH THE TAX RATE EXCEEDS THE _NO-NEW-REVENUE_  \\r\\n| [ ~~EFFECTIVE~~ ] MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS RATE) PERCENT AND WILL RAISE  \\r\\n| TAXES FOR MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS ON A $100,000 HOME BY  \\r\\n| APPROXIMATELY $(Insert amount).\"  \\r\\n|  (c) If the governing body of a taxing unit does not adopt a  \\r\\n| tax rate before the date required by Subsection (a), the tax rate  \\r\\n| for the taxing unit for that tax year is the lower of the  \\r\\n| _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate calculated for that tax year or  \\r\\n| the tax rate adopted by the taxing unit for the preceding tax year.  \\r\\n| A tax rate established by this subsection is treated as an adopted  \\r\\n| tax rate.

The governing body  \\r\\n| of a taxing unit shall reduce a tax rate set by law or by vote of the  \\r\\n| electorate to the lower of the rollback tax rate or the  \\r\\n| _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate and may not adopt a higher rate  \\r\\n| unless it first complies with Section 26.06.  \\r\\n|  _(d-1)_ _____The governing body of a taxing unit may not hold a_  \\r\\n| _public hearing on a proposed tax rate or a public meeting to adopt a_  \\r\\n| _tax rate until the 14th day after the date the officer or employee_  \\r\\n| _designated by the governing body of the taxing unit to calculate the_  \\r\\n| _no-new-revenue tax rate and the rollback tax rate for the taxing_  \\r\\n| _unit complies with Section 26.17._  \\r\\n|  _(d-2)_ _____Notwithstanding Subsection (a), the governing body of_  \\r\\n| _a taxing unit other than a school district may not adopt a tax rate_  \\r\\n| _until:_  \\r\\n|  _(1)_ _____the tax notice officer of each appraisal district_  \\r\\n| _in which the taxing unit participates has delivered the notice_  \\r\\n| _required by Section 26.04(e-2);_  \\r\\n|  _(2)_ _____the designated officer or employee of the taxing_  \\r\\n| _unit has:_  \\r\\n|  _(A)_ _____entered in the real-time tax database_  \\r\\n| _maintained by the tax notice officer the information described by_  \\r\\n| _Section 26.17(b) for the current tax year; and_  \\r\\n|  _(B)_ _____incorporated the completed tax rate_  \\r\\n| _calculation forms prepared under Section 26.04(d-1) into the_  \\r\\n| _real-time tax database maintained by the tax notice officer; and_  \\r\\n|  _(3)_ _____the taxing unit has posted the information_  \\r\\n| _described by Section 26.18 on the Internet website used by the_  \\r\\n| _taxing unit for that purpose._  \\r\\n|  (e) A person who owns taxable property is entitled to an  \\r\\n| injunction restraining the collection of taxes by a taxing unit in  \\r\\n| which the property is taxable if the taxing unit has not complied  \\r\\n| with the requirements of this section _or Section 26.04_ [ ~~and the~~  \\r\\n|  ~~failure to comply was not in good faith~~ ]. _It is a defense in an_  \\r\\n| _action for an injunction under this subsection that the failure to_  \\r\\n| _comply was in good faith._ An action to enjoin the collection of  \\r\\n| taxes must be filed _not later than the 15th day after the date the_  \\r\\n| _taxing unit adopts a tax rate.

Section 26.08, Tax Code, is amended by amending  \\r\\n| Subsections (a), (b), (d), (d-1), (d-2), (e), (g), (h), (i), (n),  \\r\\n| and (p) and adding Subsections (b-1) and (q) to read as follows:  \\r\\n|  (a) If the governing body of a _taxing unit_ [ ~~school district~~ ]  \\r\\n| adopts a tax rate that exceeds the _taxing unit's_ [ ~~district's~~ ]  \\r\\n| rollback tax rate, the registered voters of the _taxing unit_  \\r\\n| [ ~~district~~ ] at an election held for that purpose must determine  \\r\\n| whether to approve the adopted tax rate.  When increased  \\r\\n| expenditure of money by a _taxing unit_ [ ~~school district~~ ] is  \\r\\n| necessary to respond to a disaster, including a tornado, hurricane,  \\r\\n| flood, or other calamity, but not including a drought, that has  \\r\\n| impacted _the taxing unit_ [ ~~a school district~~ ] and the governor has  \\r\\n| _declared any part of_ [ ~~requested federal disaster assistance for~~ ]  \\r\\n| the area in which the _taxing unit_ [ ~~school district~~ ] is located _as\\r\\na_  \\r\\n| _disaster area_ , an election is not required under this section to  \\r\\n| approve the tax rate adopted by the governing body for the year  \\r\\n| following the year in which the disaster occurs.  \\r\\n|  (b) _This subsection applies only to a taxing unit other than_  \\r\\n| _a school district._ The governing body shall order that the election  \\r\\n| be held in the _taxing unit_ [ ~~school district~~ ] on _the uniform\\r\\nelection_  \\r\\n| _date prescribed by_ [ ~~a date not less than 30 or more than 90 days~~  \\r\\n|  ~~after the day on which it adopted the tax rate.~~ ]  Section 41.001,  \\r\\n| Election Code, _that occurs in November of the applicable tax year._  \\r\\n| _The order calling the election may not be issued later than August_  \\r\\n| _15_ [ ~~does not apply to the election unless a date specified by that~~  \\r\\n|  ~~section falls within the time permitted by this section~~ ].  At the  \\r\\n| election, the ballots shall be prepared to permit voting for or  \\r\\n| against the proposition:  \"Approving the ad valorem tax rate of  \\r\\n| $_____ per $100 valuation in (name of _taxing unit_ [ ~~school~~  \\r\\n|  ~~district~~ ]) for the current year, a rate that is $_____ higher per  \\r\\n| $100 valuation than the [ ~~school district~~ ] rollback tax rate _of_  \\r\\n| _(name of taxing unit)_ , for the purpose of (description of purpose of  \\r\\n| increase).\"  The ballot proposition must include the adopted tax  \\r\\n| rate and the difference between that rate and the rollback tax rate  \\r\\n| in the appropriate places.  \\r\\n|  _(b-1)_ _____This subsection applies only to a school district._ __  \\r\\n| _The governing body of a school district shall order that the_  \\r\\n| _election be held in the school district on the uniform election date_  \\r\\n| _prescribed by Section 41.001, Election Code, that occurs in_  \\r\\n| _November of the applicable tax year._ ___The order calling the election_  \\r\\n| _may not be issued later than August 15._ ___At the election, the_  \\r\\n| _ballots shall be prepared to permit voting for or against the_  \\r\\n| _proposition: \"Approving the ad valorem tax rate of $___ per $100_  \\r\\n| _valuation in (name of school district) for the current year, a rate_  \\r\\n| _that is $_____ higher per $100 valuation than the rollback tax rate_  \\r\\n| _of (name of school district), for the purpose of (description of_  \\r\\n| _purpose of increase)._ ___This rate will allow the school district to_  \\r\\n| _collect an amount of maintenance and operations tax revenue that is_  \\r\\n| _at least 2.5 percent greater than the amount of that revenue that_  \\r\\n| _was collected by the school district in the preceding year.\"_ ___The_  \\r\\n| _ballot proposition must include the adopted tax rate and the_  \\r\\n| _difference between that rate and the rollback tax rate in the_  \\r\\n| _appropriate places._  \\r\\n|  (d) If the proposition is not approved as provided by  \\r\\n| Subsection (c), the governing body may not adopt a tax rate for the  \\r\\n| _taxing unit_ [ ~~school district~~ ] for the current year that exceeds the  \\r\\n| _taxing unit's_ [ ~~school district's~~ ] rollback tax rate.  \\r\\n|  (d-1) If, after tax bills for the _taxing unit_ [ ~~school~~  \\r\\n|  ~~district~~ ] have been mailed, a proposition to approve the _taxing_  \\r\\n| _unit's_ [ ~~school district's~~ ] adopted tax rate is not approved by the  \\r\\n| voters of the _taxing unit_ [ ~~district~~ ] at an election held under this  \\r\\n| section, on subsequent adoption of a new tax rate by the governing  \\r\\n| body of the _taxing unit_ [ ~~district~~ ], the assessor for the _taxing\\r\\nunit_  \\r\\n| [ ~~school~~ ] shall prepare and mail corrected tax bills.  The assessor  \\r\\n| shall include with each bill a brief explanation of the reason for  \\r\\n| and effect of the corrected bill.  The date on which the taxes  \\r\\n| become delinquent for the year is extended by a number of days equal  \\r\\n| to the number of days between the date the first tax bills were sent  \\r\\n| and the date the corrected tax bills were sent.  \\r\\n|  (d-2) If a property owner pays taxes calculated using the  \\r\\n| originally adopted tax rate of the _taxing unit_ [ ~~school district~~ ]  \\r\\n| and the proposition to approve the adopted tax rate is not approved  \\r\\n| by _the_ voters, the _taxing unit_ [ ~~school district~~ ] shall refund the  \\r\\n| difference between the amount of taxes paid and the amount due under  \\r\\n| the subsequently adopted rate if the difference between the amount  \\r\\n| of taxes paid and the amount due under the subsequent rate is $1 or  \\r\\n| more.  If the difference between the amount of taxes paid and the  \\r\\n| amount due under the subsequent rate is less than $1, the _taxing_  \\r\\n| _unit_ [ ~~school district~~ ] shall refund the difference on request of  \\r\\n| the taxpayer.  An application for a refund of less than $1 must be  \\r\\n| made within 90 days after the date the refund becomes due or the  \\r\\n| taxpayer forfeits the right to the refund.  \\r\\n|  (e) For purposes of this section, local tax funds dedicated  \\r\\n| to a junior college district under Section 45.105(e), Education  \\r\\n| Code, shall be eliminated from the calculation of the tax rate  \\r\\n| adopted by the governing body of _a_ [ ~~the~~ ] school district. However,  \\r\\n| the funds dedicated to the junior college district are subject to  \\r\\n| Section 26.085.  \\r\\n|  (g) In a school district that received distributions from an  \\r\\n| equalization tax imposed under former Chapter 18, Education Code,  \\r\\n| the _no-new-revenue tax_ [ ~~effective~~ ] rate of that tax as of the date  \\r\\n| of the county unit system's abolition is added to the district's  \\r\\n| rollback tax rate.  \\r\\n|  (h) For purposes of this section, increases in taxable  \\r\\n| values and tax levies occurring within a reinvestment zone  \\r\\n| _designated_ under Chapter 311 [ ~~(Tax Increment Financing Act),~~ ] in  \\r\\n| which _a school_ [ ~~the~~ ] district is a participant[ ~~,~~ ] shall be  \\r\\n| eliminated from the calculation of the tax rate adopted by the  \\r\\n| governing body of the school district.  \\r\\n|  (i) For purposes of this section, the _no-new-revenue_  \\r\\n| [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and operations tax rate of a school  \\r\\n| district is the tax rate that, applied to the current total value  \\r\\n| for the district, would impose taxes in an amount that, when added  \\r\\n| to state funds that would be distributed to the district under  \\r\\n| Chapter 42, Education Code, for the school year beginning in the  \\r\\n| current tax year using that tax rate, would provide the same amount  \\r\\n| of state funds distributed under Chapter 42, Education Code, and  \\r\\n| maintenance and operations taxes of the district per student in  \\r\\n| weighted average daily attendance for that school year that would  \\r\\n| have been available to the district in the preceding year if the  \\r\\n| funding elements for Chapters 41 and 42, Education Code, for the  \\r\\n| current year had been in effect for the preceding year.  \\r\\n|  (n) For purposes of this section, the rollback tax rate of a  \\r\\n| school district [ ~~whose maintenance and operations tax rate for the~~  \\r\\n|  ~~2005 tax year was $1.50 or less per $100 of taxable value~~ ] is _the\\r\\nsum_  \\r\\n| _of the following_ :  \\r\\n|  (1) _the rate per $100 of taxable value that is equal to_  \\r\\n| _the product of the no-new-revenue maintenance and operations tax_  \\r\\n| _rate of the district as computed under Subsection (i) and 1.025_ [ ~~for~~  \\r\\n|  ~~the 2006 tax year, the sum of the rate that is equal to 88.67 percent~~  \\r\\n|  ~~of the maintenance and operations tax rate adopted by the district~~  \\r\\n|  ~~for the 2005 tax year, the rate of $0.04 per $100 of taxable value,~~  \\r\\n|  ~~and the district's current debt rate~~ ];

and~~  \\r\\n|  [ ~~(iii)~~ ] the district's current debt rate.  \\r\\n|  (p) Notwithstanding Subsections (i) _and_ [ ~~,~~ ] (n), [ ~~and (o),~~ ]  \\r\\n| if for the preceding tax year a school district adopted a  \\r\\n| maintenance and operations tax rate that was less than the  \\r\\n| district's _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and operations  \\r\\n| tax rate for that preceding tax year, the rollback tax rate of the  \\r\\n| district for the current tax year is calculated as if the district  \\r\\n| adopted a maintenance and operations tax rate for the preceding tax  \\r\\n| year that was equal to the district's _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ]  \\r\\n| maintenance and operations tax rate for that preceding tax year.  \\r\\n|  _(q)_ _____Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, this_  \\r\\n| _section does not apply to a tax imposed by a taxing unit if a_  \\r\\n| _provision of an uncodified local or special law enacted by the 86th_  \\r\\n| _Legislature, Regular Session, 2019, or by an earlier legislature_  \\r\\n| _provides that former Section 26.07 does not apply to a tax imposed_  \\r\\n| _by the taxing unit._  \\r\\n|  SECTION 43.

The notice of the hearings must_  \\r\\n| _state the date and time that the first hearing will begin, state the_  \\r\\n| _date the last hearing will end, and list the order in which the_  \\r\\n| _hearings will be held. The order of the hearings listed in the_  \\r\\n| _notice may not be changed without the agreement of the property_  \\r\\n| _owner or the designated agent of the owner, the chief appraiser, and_  \\r\\n| _the appraisal review board.

If a protest is scheduled to be heard by a  \\r\\n| particular panel, the protest may not be reassigned to another  \\r\\n| panel without the consent of the property owner or _the_ designated  \\r\\n| agent _of the owner_. If the appraisal review board has cause to  \\r\\n| reassign a protest to another panel, a property owner or _the_  \\r\\n| designated agent _of the owner_ may agree to reassignment of the  \\r\\n| protest or may request that the hearing on the protest be postponed.  \\r\\n| The board shall postpone the hearing on that request. A change of  \\r\\n| members of a panel because of a conflict of interest, illness, or  \\r\\n| inability to continue participating in hearings for the remainder  \\r\\n| of the day does not constitute reassignment of a protest to another  \\r\\n| panel.  \\r\\n|  _(k-1)_ _____On the request of a property owner or the designated_  \\r\\n| _agent of the owner, an appraisal review board to which Section 6.425_  \\r\\n| _applies shall assign a protest relating to property described by_  \\r\\n| _Section 6.425(b) to a special panel. In addition, the chairman of_  \\r\\n| _the appraisal review board may assign a protest relating to_  \\r\\n| _property not described by Section 6.425(b) to a special panel as_  \\r\\n| _authorized by Section 6.425(f).

If a protest is_  \\r\\n| _scheduled to be heard by a particular special panel, the protest may_  \\r\\n| _not be reassigned to another special panel without the consent of_  \\r\\n| _the property owner or the designated agent of the owner.

A change of members of a special panel because of a_  \\r\\n| _conflict of interest, illness, or inability to continue_  \\r\\n| _participating in hearings for the remainder of the day does not_  \\r\\n| _constitute reassignment of a protest to another special panel._  \\r\\n|  _(p)_ _____At the end of a hearing on a protest, the appraisal_  \\r\\n| _review board shall provide the property owner or the designated_  \\r\\n| _agent of the owner one or more documents indicating that the members_  \\r\\n| _of the board hearing the protest signed the affidavit required by_  \\r\\n| _Subsection (g)._  \\r\\n|  SECTION 56.

determined under subchapter m chapter 403 government code for the preceding tax year to the taxable value of the detached or annexed property determined under title 1 tax code for the preceding tax year b for purposes of this subchapter the taxable value of all or a portion of a parcel or item of real property includes the taxable value of personal property having taxable situs at the same location as the real property sec 49.303 41.203 property subject to detachment and annexation a only the following property may be detached and annexed under this subchapter 1 a mineral property 2

commercial purposes other than property used primarily for agriculture or for residential purposes b if a final judgment of a court determines that a mineral interest may not be annexed and detached as provided by this subchapter without an attendant annexation and detachment of the surface estate or any other interest in the same land the detachment and annexation of a mineral interest under this subchapter includes the surface estate and each other interest in the land covered by the mineral interest sec 49.304 41.204 taxation of personal property personal property having a taxable situs at the same location as real property detached and annexed under this subchapter is taxable by the school district to which the real property is annexed sec 49.305 41.205 detachment of property a the

with the parcel or item having the greatest taxable value until the school district's local revenue level wealth per student is equal to or less than the equalized wealth level established under section 48.257 except as otherwise provided by subsection c c if the detachment of whole parcels or items of property as provided by subsection a would result in a district's local revenue level wealth per student that is less than the equalized wealth level established under section 48.257 by more than the product of 10,000 multiplied by weighted average daily attendance the commissioner may not detach the last parcel or item of property and shall detach the next one or more parcels or items of property in descending order of taxable value that would result in the school district having a local revenue level wealth per student that is equal to or less than the equalized wealth level established under section 48.257 by not more than the product of 10,000 multiplied by weighted average daily attendance d notwithstanding subsections a b and c the commissioner may detach only a portion of a parcel or item of property if 1 it is not possible under this subchapter to reduce the district's local revenue level wealth per student to a level that is equal to or less than the equalized wealth level established under section 48.257 this subchapter unless some or all of the parcel

the equalized wealth level established under section 48.257 by more than the product of 10,000 multiplied by weighted average daily attendance or 2 the commissioner determines that a partial detachment of that parcel or item of property is preferable to the detachment of one or more other parcels or items having a lower taxable value in order to minimize the number of parcels or items of property to be detached consistent with the purposes of this chapter sec 49.306 41.206 annexation of property a the commissioner shall annex property detached under section 49.305 41.205 to school

whether the property is contiguous to other property in that district c the commissioner shall annex property detached from school districts beginning with the property detached from the school district with the greatest local revenue level in excess of entitlement wealth per student before detachment and continuing with the property detached from each other school district in descending order of the district's local revenue level in excess of entitlement wealth per student before detachment d the commissioner shall annex the parcels or items of property detached from a school district to other school districts that are eligible for annexation of property in descending order of the taxable value of each parcel or item according to the following priorities 1 first to the eligible school districts assigned to the same county as the school district from which the property is detached whose total adopted tax rate for the preceding tax year does not exceed by more than 0.15 the total tax rate adopted for that year by the school district from which the property is detached 2 second to the eligible school districts served by the same regional education service center as the district from which the property is detached whose total adopted tax rate for the preceding tax year does not exceed by more than 0.10 the total tax rate adopted for that year by the school district from which the property is detached and 3 third to other eligible school districts whose total adopted tax rate for the preceding tax year does not exceed by more than 0.05 the total tax rate adopted for that year by the school district from which the property is detached e if the districts identified by subsection d for a school district are insufficient to annex all the property detached from the school district the commissioner shall increase for purposes of this section all the maximum difference in tax rates allowed under subsection d in increments of 0.01 until the districts are identified that are sufficient to annex all the property detached from the district f if only one school district is eligible to annex property detached from a school district within a priority group established by subsections d and e the commissioner shall annex property to that district until it reaches the taxable value of property necessary to generate maintenance and operations tax revenue in the amount equal to the district's entitlement under section 48.202(a 1)(2 a wealth per student equal as nearly as possible to the greatest level for which funds are provided under subchapter f chapter 42 by annexing whole parcels or items of property any remaining detached property shall be annexed to eligible school districts in the next priority group as provided by this section g if more than one school district is eligible to annex property detached from a school district within a priority group established by subsections d and e the commissioner shall first annex property to the district within the priority group to which could be annexed the most taxable value of property without increasing the district's taxable value of property to an amount that exceeds the amount necessary to generate maintenance and operations tax revenue in the amount equal to the district's entitlement under section 48.202(a 1)(2 its wealth per student above the greatest level for which funds are provided under subchapter f chapter 42 until that district reaches a taxable value of property necessary to generate maintenance and operations tax revenue in the amount equal to the district's entitlement under section 48.202(a 1)(2 wealth per student equal as nearly as possible to the greatest level for which funds are provided under subchapter f chapter 42 by annexing whole parcels or items of property then any additional detached property shall be annexed in the same manner to other eligible school districts in the same priority group in descending order of capacity to receive taxable value of annexed property without increasing the district's taxable value of property to an amount that exceeds the amount necessary to generate maintenance and operations tax revenue in the amount equal to the district's entitlement under section 48.202(a 1)(2 wealth per student above the greatest level for which funds are provided under subchapter f chapter 42 if every school district in a priority group reaches a taxable value of property necessary to generate maintenance and operations tax revenue in the amount equal to the district's entitlement under section 48.202(a 1)(2 wealth per student equal to the greatest level for which funds are provided under subchapter f chapter 42 as nearly as possible the remaining detached property shall be annexed to school districts in the next priority group in the manner provided by this section h for purposes of this section a portion of a parcel or item of property detached in that subdivided form from a school district is treated as a whole parcel or item of property i the commissioner may order the annexation of a portion of a parcel or item of property including a portion of property treated as a whole parcel or item under subsection h if 1 the annexation of the whole parcel or item would result in the district eligible to receive it in the appropriate priority order provided by this section having a local revenue level wealth per student greater than the amount by which the product of 10,000 multiplied by weighted average daily attendance exceeds the taxable value of property necessary to generate maintenance and operations tax revenue in the amount equal to the district's entitlement under section 48.202(a 1)(2 more than the greatest level for which funds are provided under subchapter f chapter 42 or 2 the commissioner determines that annexation of portions of the parcel or item would reduce disparities in district taxable values of property necessary to generate maintenance and operations tax revenue in the amount equal to a district's entitlement under section 48.202(a 1)(2 wealth per student more efficiently than would be possible if the parcel or item were annexed as a whole j the commissioner may modify the priorities established by this section as the commissioner considers reasonable to minimize or reduce the number of school districts to which the property detached from a school district is annexed to minimize or reduce the geographic dispersal of property in a school district to minimize or reduce disparities in school district taxable values of
